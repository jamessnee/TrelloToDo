A super simple example of using the py-trello [0] python wrapper around the Trello
API [1] to scrape 'TODO' tags from a file and fill a ToDo board with a list for
each new ToDo item.

The current ToDo board defaults to being called 'Thesis ToDo' (guess what I'm
doing).

Usage: You must have py-trello installed (super simple) and have a creds.txt
file in the same dir as this script. The creds.txt must contain the credentials
necessary for py-trello to work.
